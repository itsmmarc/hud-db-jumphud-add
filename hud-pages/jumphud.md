Toggle Custom HUD Speedos, Tempus HUD, Tempus Speedos, etc, using the buttons on the pause menu.

Adjust the item menu background to your resolution by editing `CUSTOMIZATION/aspect_ratio.res`.

Edit and enable a custom HUD crosshair by editing `CUSTOMIZATION/crosshair.res`.

Change the tempus speedo colour by editing `cfg/speedocolor.cfg`.

## Known Issues:

HUD speedos start to flicker more the longer a map has been running.

Tempus speedos won't be recoloured or repositioned until one of the speedo buttons on the pause menu is used.

Tempus HUD elements are stubborn and sometimes reset to their natural colour. Turning the Tempus HUD on and off usually fixes this.

Inventory menu background may not load on some `sv_pure` protected servers.
